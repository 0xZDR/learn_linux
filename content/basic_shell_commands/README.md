## Basic Shell Commands (BASH)
So now we know what kernel and shell are, we can go into shell commands.

# __IMPORTANT:__
## The very important command one should learn is the __man__ command.

This command is Linux's manual pager. You can us this to check almost all commands' manual in Linux.
```
# usage

man man
```
