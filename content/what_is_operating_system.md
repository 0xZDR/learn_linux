## What is Operating System
To understand what is OS, you need to understand hardware and how programs are ran on hardwares.
Here we use SCM (Single Chip Microcomputer) as an example.
How can multiple programs run on one chip?
Even if we have multiple programs running, how can we stop them intervene each others' memory?
How do we manage files?
What about interrupts?

Now we need something to operate these 'resources', which introduces us into Operating Systems.

### Kernel
To my understanding, kernel is the most essential part of an OS, which includes all necessary functions to "operate" the resources. But this is just a simple and partial description, you can read this.

### Shell
After you have a kernel, how would you interact with it? When you want to send commands to the kernel, you have your very OG user interface ---- the shell.
