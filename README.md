# How I learn Linux
This repo is mainly aiming at helping a person to get farmiliar with Linux and can start using Linux. Some of this repo is from my translation of an [open source Chinese Linux book](https://www.linuxprobe.com/), somee is from my reading from other blogs. Hopefully I can write a thing or two some day.

Before going into linux, reading this might help you understanding the relations between different Linux distributions and why some programmers prefer Macbooks. [What is POSIX?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1780599/what-is-the-meaning-of-posix)
