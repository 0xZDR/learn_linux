# An introduction to Linux
## Intro
This repo is mainly aiming at helping a person to get familiar with Linux and can start using Linux.
Some of these are written by me, and some are referred to other resources.
I constructed a structure of the knowledge on a gradual base, and hopefully can help you get into the world of Linux.

Disclaimer: English is my second language. If you are confused, please let me know. Also if you find anything that is not correct, please do let me know; I hope this repo can help people but not mislead them.
