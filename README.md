# How I learn Linux
This repo is mainly aiming at helping a person to get farmiliar with Linux and can start using Linux.
I constructed a structure of the knowledge I think would be helpful, and then attached the urls to where I learned the knowledge (or where I found them and think it would be good).

Before going into linux, read this might help you understanding the relations between different Linux distributions and why some programmers prefer Macbooks.
